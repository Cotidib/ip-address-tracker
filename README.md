# ip-adress-tracker
This is a solution to the [IP Address Tracker challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0).  

### The challenge
Your challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 
Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location


### Built with
- HTML5, CSS3
- Mobile-first workflow
- React JS and React Hooks
- Node Js and Express
- [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)
- [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/)
